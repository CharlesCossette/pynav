    "## Traditional example\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll simulate a simple 2D localization problem as per the figure below. We'll assume that we have a robot following a typical bicycle model, which has access to noisy measurements of its forward velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\\omega$. In addition, this robot will have a time-of-flight sensor that gives it range measurements to a few known landmarks in the environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to define the state of the robot. We'll start with a more traditional approach and define the state of the robot to be a vector of the form $\\mathbf{x} = [x, y, \\theta]$, where $x$ and $y$ are the robot's position in the world and $\\theta$ is its orientation. We'll also define the control inputs to be $\\mathbf{u} = [v, \\omega]$, the robot's forward and angular velocity. The process (motion) model of the robot is then given by:\n",

    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\dot{x} &= v \\cos(\\theta), \\\\\n",

    "    \\dot{\\theta} &= \\omega.\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is in continuous time, and we need to discretize it to use it in a filter. For now, we'll use the simple Euler discretization method, which gives us the following discrete-time process model:\n",

    "Lets now code up our state and process model using navlie's framework. Since our state is just a regular 3x1 vector, we can use a standard type from the built-in library: `navlie.lib.VectorState` \n"
